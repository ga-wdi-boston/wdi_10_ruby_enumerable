# Basic enumeration on collection objects (hash, array)

# This is NOT the Enumerable module.
# The name is close, but this is just us writing implementation of all of the enumerable methods in actions
class MyEnumeration
  # Do not modify the initialize
  # This statement allows the rspec tests to create a new collection that will then be tested
  # MyEnumeration.new(['foo', 'bar'])
  def initialize(collection)
    @collection = collection

  # Refer to count
  # http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/Enumerable.html#method-i-count

    # collection here refers to the collection that is set with the initialize method
    # collection() is a private accessor method at the bottom of this class that accesses @collection
    collection.count

  # Try it yourself!
